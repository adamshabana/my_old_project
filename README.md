This is what I'll talk about during interviews

For the SuperstoreDataSubmission, My team and I were able to organize raw data of orders gathered from a Superstore and compare profits per product Sub-Category. 

- We were also able to show profits for regions that the stores operated in within the United States from orders each year. 
- Profits and Losses of each product category and discount amount 
- The lowest performing sub-category profit loss compared from stores across regions 
- Lastly, the total yearly profits made across each year

For the Trends in Automative Performance: 1970-1982, My team and I cleaned and prepared data visualizations through scatterplots and regression analysis to present the supported and unsupported relationships between variables that best relate to automobile performance. 
- Variables discussed include: Horsepower, Acceleration, Miles per Gallon, Displacement, and Car weight.
